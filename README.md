# Configuration file repo

This repo contains my configuration files for

* Emacs
* Bash
* Git

Everytime I think about something else

# Todo list :

* Add a script that installs these config files
* Add a script that backups config files somewhere
* Add a script that saves current config files of some machine to the repo.
